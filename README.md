🚢 Titanic Survival Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival during the disaster. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to extract meaningful insights.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Identify key factors affecting survival

Visualize patterns and trends using charts and plots

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib – data visualization

Seaborn – statistical data visualization

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Information

Dataset Name: Titanic Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Description: Contains passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, family size, and survival status.

🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)

Dropped irrelevant or highly null columns

Converted categorical variables into usable formats

Checked for duplicates and inconsistencies

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analyses performed:

Survival rate comparison by gender

Survival analysis based on passenger class

Impact of age and fare on survival

Family size vs survival probability

Correlation analysis between numerical features

features

📈 Data Visualization

Visualizations created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Bar plots for survival comparison

Count plots for categorical variables

Histograms for age and fare distribution

Heatmap for correlation analysis

Box plots to detect outliers

💡 Key Insights

Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate

First-class passengers were more likely to survive

Children had better survival chances compared to adults

Higher fares generally correlated with higher survival probability

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, EDA, and visualization using Python. The insights derived help understand how different factors influenced survival outcomes on the Titanic.
